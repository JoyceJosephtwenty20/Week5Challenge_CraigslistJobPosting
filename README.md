"# Week5Challenge_CraigslistJobPosting" 


Build an application that allows users to add jobs, list jobs and view jobs.

Your client has requested specifically for a unified look across all your pages. Your program manager has made these styling mandatory:

Same navigation bar across all pages. 
In the navigation bar, give your app a name (eg. "Cragslist Wanna Be"), or a logo.
Each button must have meaningful names (ie. "Home" is fine. "Link1" or "Page1" is not.)
